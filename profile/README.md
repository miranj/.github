We’re [Miranj][1] — a strategic web design and development studio.
We’re a small team distributed in India 🇮🇳 and Cambodia 🇰🇭,
and work with [a strong sense of purpose][2].
We love building content-heavy websites and have been helping [a diverse set
of clients][3] (from independent filmmakers to non-profits) with content strategy,
design, and development since 2011.

While we create meaningful web experiences for our clients,
we also like to share our knowledge and code with the web community.
A lot of our websites are built on Craft CMS, and so naturally,
several of our open-source code bases are focused around Craft.
We have published a [few free Craft plugins][ps] and continue to host
[a Packagist server for Craft CMS 2][p2].
