## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

We’re Miranj — a strategic web design and development studio.
We’re a small team remotely distributed in India 🇮🇳 and Cambodia 🇰🇭.
We love doing content-heavy websites and have been helping a diverse set
of clients (from independent filmmakers to non-profits) with content strategy,
design and development since 2011.

While we create meaningful web experiences for our clients,
we also like to share our knowledge and code with the web community.
A lot of our websites are built on Craft CMS, and so naturally,
several of our open-source code bases are focused around Craft.
We have published a few free Craft plugins and continue to host
a Packagist server for Craft CMS 2.
